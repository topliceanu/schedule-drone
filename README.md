schedule-drone
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/topliceanu/schedule-drone.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/topliceanu/schedule-drone)

A reliable , fault-tolerant, persistent event scheduler for node.js
It achieves it's resiliance by storing event configurations on disk.
Currently only MongoDB persistance is supported.

Install
-------

````bash
npm install schedule-drone
````

Development
-----------

````bash
git clone git@github.com:topliceanu/schedule-drone.git
cd schedule-drone
npm install
npm test # To run the tests.
npm build # To build the js files that are published to npm
````

Example
-------

````coffeescript
drone = require 'schedule-drone'
drone.setConfig
    persistence:
        type: 'mongodb'
        connectionString: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/scheduled-events'
        options: {} # Some mongodb driver options here.

scheduler = drone.daemon()

# Add a one-time event scheduled in the future, given a Date instance.
scheduler.schedule dateInFuture, 'my-one-time-event', params

# Add the cyclic event using the standard unix cron syntax.
scheduler.schedule '* * * * * 1', 'my-cron-event', params

scheduler.on 'my-one-time-event', (params) ->
    # Do something awesome

````

Api
---

`drone.setConfig()` - pass in configuration needed for the module's api to work. At the very least the connection string to the persistence layer must be supplied.

`drone.daemon()` - start the scheduler daemon. It listens to new scheduled events, stores then, and triggeres them appropriately. Returns an instance of a PersistenceScheduler.

`class PersistentScheduler` - inherits from `events.EventEmitter`

`PersistenceScheduler.schedule(when:String|Date, event:String, data:Object, callback:Function)`
- schedules an event in the future without storing it on disk.
- `when` can be a [crontab syntax string](http://crontab.org/) for cyclic events or an instance of [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) in the future for one-time events.

`PersistenceScheduler.scheduleAndStore(when:String|Date, event:String, data:Object, callbac:Function)`
- schedules and events in the future and stores it on disk.
- `when` can be a [crontab syntax string](http://crontab.org/) for cyclic events or an instance of [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) in the future for one-time events.

`drone.schedule(dataOrCronString, eventName, eventPayload, callback)`
- useful for scheduling events without actually needing to listen to when they occur (ie in another process)
- the _optional_  `callback` is called when an error occurs while persisting the task.
